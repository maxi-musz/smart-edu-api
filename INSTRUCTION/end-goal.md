🏫 Platform Overview and New Multi-School Management Capability
📌 Overview
The platform is a robust, multi-tenant school management system designed to help individual schools manage their academic and administrative operations. Each school operates independently and has access to features such as:
Student and staff onboarding
Class scheduling and subject management
Financial tracking and payment records
Performance reporting and academic calendars
🆕 New Capability: Organization-Based Multi-School Management
The system is now being extended to support a new structure where an organization can register and manage multiple schools under its umbrella.
With this addition:

An organization can onboard and oversee multiple schools
Each school still manages its students, staff, and academic activities independently
The organization can upload or assign shared learning content (e.g., videos, PDFs, tests)
Centralized reporting and monitoring becomes possible at both school and organizational levels
Parents can now be included to monitor their child’s academic journey
🎯 Goal
This enhancement allows the platform to serve both individual schools and large educational organizations—such as content providers, school groups, or NGOs—who wish to manage multiple schools from a single dashboard, while still preserving the independence of each school.
